# Chess Board Detection and Move Generation System

This project automates the detection of chess pieces on a physical chessboard and updates the board state using FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation). The system integrates image processing for chess piece detection with the Stockfish chess engine and a custom build object detection model to generate legal moves, as well as an Arduino-based hardware setup to physically move the chess pieces.

## Features

- **Image Processing for Chess Piece Detection**: 
   - Captures and processes images of the chessboard.
   - Detects the presence and type of chess pieces, distinguishing between blank spaces, black pieces, and white pieces, using a YOLO object detection build from a custom dataset consisting of 7300 images
- **FEN Generation**:
   - Updates the chessboard state in FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) format based on piece detection.
   - Tracks changes in the board state such as piece movement and captures.

- **Stockfish Integration**:
   - Uses the Stockfish chess engine to validate and generate legal moves based on the current FEN.
   - Automatically adjusts the board state to reflect the best move generated by Stockfish.

- **Arduino Integration for Piece Movement**:
   - Controls an Arduino setup with servos and stepper motors to physically move chess pieces.
   - Supports basic actions like moving pieces and capturing opponent pieces.
   - Reads from an additional Arduino to get data from the sensors to check for some criteria

## System Architecture

1. **Frontend**: A touch-screen interface where users can interact with the chessboard, confirm moves, and get real-time feedback.
2. **Backend**: 
   - Python scripts handle image detection, FEN generation, and communication with the Stockfish engine.
   - A Flask API for integrating the move generation and FEN validation processes.
3. **Hardware**:
   - Arduino Uno and Mega boards control stepper motors and servos, providing precise movement for chess pieces.
   - Ultrasonic sensors and motion sensors detect the presence of obstacles and ensure safe piece manipulation.
